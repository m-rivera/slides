# ViCEPHEC 2024 Animations
Here is the source code for the slides of my talk at the University of Surrey for ViCEPHEC 2024.

You can view the talk directly [here](https://m-rivera.github.io/talks/away_2024/talk.html).

The animations depend on the `manim` library and their compilation as HTML uses `manim-slides`.
To compile the animations and slides, run `compile.sh`.
